Hi, I’m @trentmorey
I'm a professional accountant looking to diversify my skillset.
I’m interested in blockchain, DeFi, and cryptocurrency.
I’m currently learning Solidity and Javascript.
In the future I'd love to work as a developer and leverage my prior experience as an accountant. I'm fascinated by the potential for DeFi to re-invent the global financial architecture.
